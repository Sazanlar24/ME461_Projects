This repository documents all coursework, including the term project, for ME461: Mechatronic Components and Instrument, a course offered in Fall 2024 at Middle East Technical University (METU).
Some areas focused on throughout the semester:
- Microprocessor board (rpi pico w) programming (w/ microPython)
- Path planning
- Image processing
- Communication protocols
- Mechatronics components: DC motor, servo motor, rotary encoder, stepper
- ROS2 and so on.

At the end of the semester all different areas are combined in a comprehensive term project that all group members worked very hard for 2 weeks.
